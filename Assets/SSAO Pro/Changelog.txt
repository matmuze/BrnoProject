1.2.3
- Fixed : Unity 5 beta compatibility. Simply extract the "Unity5_compatibility" package.

1.2.2
- Fixed : Transparent objects aren't affected by the ambient occlusion anymore.

1.2.1
- Fixed : No more HideFlags errors on build.

1.2
- Added : A new, more predictable SSAO variant. This one doesn't depend on the clipping planes and fixes a few self-shadowing bugs. The old SSAO is still available (use the "SSAO Mode" dropdown).
- Modified : The old SSAO mode "1.1 (Legacy)" now uses a higher precision depth map and works better with the forward rendering path.
- Modified : Distance cutoff is now always enabled, bringing the "shader keywords" requirement down to 10.
- Modified : The default noise texture is now automatically applied on creation.
- Misc : Documentation update.
- Note : Due to some heavy refactoring, upgrading from previous version of SSAO Pro may fail. It's best to remove SSAO Pro from your project entirely and reimport the last version.

1.1
- Added : Downsampling. You can choose to downsample the AO pass only or AO + Blur, so you can better control the speed-quality ratio depending on your scene.
- Removed : Useless "Bilateral Threshold" parameter. This is now hardcoded into the shader.
- Misc : Documentation update. The "Performances" section has been rewritten and populated with more useful data.

1.0.2
- Added a new quickstart launcher when you import or update SSAO Pro.
- Added "About SSAO Pro" and "SSAO Pro Manual" in the Help menu.
- Fixed : The effect wasn't working properly in DirectX mode using the forward rendering path and MSAA.
- Misc : Various documentation fixes & additions.

1.0.1
- Initial release.
